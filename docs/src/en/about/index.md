# About

### Is Ham safe?
Ham does not send your student account and password to a third-party server for validation. Your account data is stored locally, and your phone connects directly to the university servers.

Some features (like grade distribution) require a backend service. When data must be sent, it is only sent with your consent. Sensitive identifiers (such as student ID) are hashed before transmission, so we cannot identify individual users.

### Why is it not open source (yet)?
The project includes private credentials (push services, Apple developer account, etc.), so it is not open source for now. Ham is still completely free to use.

If you have suggestions, feel free to chat with us on Gitter. Technical discussions are welcome too.
