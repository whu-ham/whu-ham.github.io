# User Agreement

This agreement sets out the rights and obligations between Ham and users for Ham software services (the "Service"). "User" refers to any individual who downloads, installs, registers, logs in, or uses the Service (collectively, "use"). Before registering, Ham hereby reminds you to read this User Agreement (the "Agreement") carefully to ensure you fully understand all terms. Please read and understand the terms carefully, especially those related to limitation or exclusion of liability, rights licensing and information use, consent to special services, applicable law, and dispute resolution. Important terms such as exclusions or limitations of liability will be highlighted in bold. If you do not agree to this Agreement, Ham cannot provide complete products and services, and you may choose to stop using the Service. If you choose to agree or use Ham and related services, you are deemed to have fully understood and accepted this Agreement and other agreements and rules related to Ham (including but not limited to this Agreement).

To provide better services, or due to changes in laws, policies, technology, or product features, Ham may revise this Agreement from time to time. Revisions form part of this Agreement. After updates, Ham will notify users via the official website announcement or other appropriate ways. Users can also view the latest version on the website homepage or in app settings. Continued use of Ham and related services indicates acceptance of the revised Agreement.

## 1. Account Registration

1. Users must register a Ham account before using the Service. Ham may change account registration or binding methods based on user needs or product requirements.

2. Given Ham account binding methods, you agree that Ham may use information such as social accounts or phone numbers provided by you during registration.

3. You understand and agree that account information (name, avatar, profile, and other personal information) must comply with laws and Ham rules. It must not contain illegal or inappropriate content, and must not impersonate others (including using another person's name, title, avatar, etc.) or otherwise cause confusion. You must not maliciously register accounts (including frequent or batch registrations). You must comply with laws and regulations and not engage in behavior that harms national interests, infringes on others' legal rights, or violates public morals. Ham has the right to review registration information.

4. During registration and use, Ham may collect personal information needed to identify you or to provide better service. This may include your name, gender, age, date of birth, ID number, address, school, company, industry, interests, frequent locations, and personal profile. Ham's use of this information is subject to the personal information protection provisions in Section 3.

## 2. Service Content

1. The specific content of the Service is provided by Ham based on actual conditions, including but not limited to horoscope and weather queries. To improve user experience, Ham may change its services from time to time (including software modifications, upgrades, feature enhancements, new services, or replacements). Users will be notified of such changes (including system prompts, announcements, or in-app messages). Users may choose to accept updates; if you do not update, some features may be limited or unavailable.

2. Ham grants users a personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-commercial license to use Ham software and related services. All other rights not expressly granted remain with Ham. Before exercising those rights, you must obtain written permission from Ham. Failure to exercise a right does not constitute a waiver.

3. Ham services include free and paid services. Users may purchase paid services via online banking, Alipay, or other payment methods provided by Ham. For paid services, Ham will provide clear notice before use. Only after you agree to pay and complete payment can you use paid services. Completion is determined by the "payment completed" confirmation from the bank or third-party payment platform.

## 3. Protection of User Personal Information

1. During registration or use, users may be required to submit certain necessary personal information as required by laws and regulations. If submitted information is incomplete or non-compliant, you may be unable to use the Service or may be restricted during use.

2. User personal information includes: (1) information provided by the user (such as phone number, location when enabling location services); (2) information shared by other parties; and (3) information lawfully collected by Ham to provide services (such as device or software information, browsing history, and time data). Personal information refers to any information recorded electronically or otherwise that can identify a specific natural person alone or in combination with other information. You understand and agree that Ham will process and protect personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy published by Ham. You are encouraged to read and understand the Privacy Policy in full and make appropriate choices as needed.

3. Ham values personal information protection and will take technical and other necessary measures to keep it secure and prevent leakage, damage, or loss. If such an incident occurs or is likely to occur, Ham will take remedial measures and inform the user. Users who discover such issues should contact Ham immediately.

4. Ham will not disclose user personal information to any third party without your consent, except:
    - When required by laws or competent authorities;
    - When personal information is disclosed due to the user sharing account credentials or other non-Ham causes;

7. Ham will collect, use, or disclose personal information lawfully, properly, and as necessary, and will not collect information unrelated to the Service.

8. Ham has a Privacy Policy. Users should read and understand it before using Ham products and/or services. If you disagree with the policy, the Service may not function properly or as intended.

3. Users are fully responsible for the authenticity, legality, harmlessness, accuracy, and effectiveness of content transmitted through their accounts. Any legal liability arising from such content is borne by the user. If Ham or third parties suffer losses, the user shall compensate accordingly.

4. The Service may include advertisements. Users agree to display ads from Ham and third-party providers or partners during use.

## 6. Account Management

1. Ham accounts are owned by Ham. After registration, users obtain the right to use the account, which belongs only to the initial registrant. Transfer, lending, rental, assignment, or sale is prohibited. If Ham finds or reasonably suspects the account user is not the original registrant, it may suspend or terminate service and permanently disable the account to protect account security.

2. Users can (1) view and edit profile information, (2) view, modify, delete, or cancel account information via "Settings." Note that deleting information also removes stored text and images.

3. Users must properly safeguard account information and passwords. Losses caused by poor protection are the user's responsibility. Users are legally responsible for actions under their account. Users must not use another user's account or password. If you suspect unauthorized use, you must notify Ham immediately.

4. Users must comply with this Agreement and use the Service correctly. If a user violates any terms, Ham may suspend or terminate services for the account after notice.

5. Users can cancel their accounts via "Settings" -> "Sign Out" (entry points may change without notice). Ham will assist with cancellation after verifying identity, security status, device information, and infringement complaints, and will delete user account information as requested unless otherwise required by law. Account cancellation is irreversible. Users must back up data related to their Ham account and ensure services are properly handled. Cancellation does not exempt the account from responsibilities prior to cancellation. If during cancellation the account is subject to complaint or investigation, Ham may terminate the cancellation process at its discretion.

## 7. Risk Assumption

You understand and agree that Ham only provides a platform for information sharing, transmission, and access. You are responsible for all actions under your account, including content transmitted and any consequences. You should judge the content in Ham and the Service on your own and bear all risks, including risks arising from reliance on correctness, completeness, or usefulness. Ham does not and will not bear any responsibility for losses or damages caused by user behavior.
